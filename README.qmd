# ContextualDAG

Julia implementation of contextual directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from the paper ['Contextual directed acyclic graphs'].

## Installation

To install `ContextualDAG` from GitHub, run the following code:

```{julia}
#| eval: false
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/ryan-thompson/ContextualDAG.jl")
```

## Usage

The `cdag()` function fits a contextual DAG using variables `x` and contextual features `z`.

```{julia}
using ContextualDAG, Graphs, Random, TikzGraphs

Random.seed!(1)

# Generate iid Gaussian covariates
n = 100 # Number of samples
p = 5 # Number of variables (nodes)
m = 2 # Number of contextual features
x, x_val = randn(n, p), randn(n, p) # Variables (nodes)
z, z_val = randn(n, m), randn(n, m) # Contextual features

# Fit a contextual DAG model with three hidden layers of 16 neurons each
fit = cdag(x, z, x_val, z_val,  hidden_layers = [16, 16, 16], verbose = false)

# Predict for a new draw of z
z_new = randn(1, m)
w = coef(fit, z_new)
w[:, :, 1] |> SimpleDiGraph |> plot
```

```{julia}
# And for another draw of z
z_new = randn(1, m)
w = coef(fit, z_new)
w[:, :, 1] |> SimpleDiGraph |> plot
```
